  <h1>My Config</h1>

  <h2>Key bindings</h2>
  <p>
    When I moved from Windows to Mac, I was shocked by the awkward positioning
    of the CTRL and CMD keys, and had thumb pain within weeks. I have since
    heavily rebound my keyboard and I have honed in on an efficient and
    comfortable layout for development, window management, and general use.
  </p>
  <p>Main rebinds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      CAPS LOCK → CMD if held, ESCAPE if alone
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is my favourite rebind. CMD is used all across macOS: opening and
          closing tabs, switching tabs my number, copying and pasting, and so
          on. This puts CMD right under my pinky, making the key fast and
          unmissable.
        </li>
        <li>
          This keybinding is also extremely useful for quickly correcting
          mistakes while touch typing, because CMD+BACKSPACE to delete the
          previous word is near instantaneous, and deleting the entire previous
          mistyped word and retyping it is faster than trying to backspace the
          correct number of times.
        </li>
        <li>
          I can hold CAPS LOCK and comfortably hit any other key with either
          hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          I trigger CAPS LOCK with LEFT SHIFT + RIGHT SHIFT. This is a little
          awkward but I almost always hold shift instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      RETURN → CTRL if held, RETURN if alone
      <ul>
        <li>CTRL is used a lot in terminal programs on Mac.</li>
        <li>
          This rebind is only comfortable when I am performing CTRL with my
          right hand and the rest of the combo with my left hand e.g. CTRL+C/D,
          otherwise I use the normal CTRL key.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      CMD → HYPER 1, CMD+SHIFT → HYPER 2
      <ul>
        <li>
          Both CMD keys are remapped to 'HYPER 1' which I use to switch between
          windows e.g. 'HYPER 1' + 1 switches to workspace 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          I move an application to a specific workspace with CMD+SHIFT e.g.
          'HYPER 2' + 7 moves the focussed app to workspace 7.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Window management</h2>
  <a href="https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace">Aerospace</a> is a
  powerful, free and open source window manager for MacOS. It is aimed at
  advanced, keyboard centric users and fully configurable with a dot-file (<a
    href="https://github.com/georgeamccarthy/my-configs/blob/main/.aerospace.toml"
    >here's mine</a
  >). A few notes about my Aerospace config:
  <ul>
    <li>
      I use dedicated, named workspaces for my most frequently used singleton
      applications. For example, my browser, ChatGPT, and Zotero are on
      dedicated workspaces.
    </li>
    <li>
      My projects live on numbered workspaces which I reconfigure frequently
      depending on what I'm working on. I also use numbered workspaces for
      anything that doesn't have a dedicated workspace.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Great software</h2>
  (All
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a
  >)
  <ul>
    <li>Helium: an excellent Chromium fork.</li>
    <li>
      Ghostty: a Mac-first hardware accelerated terminal emulator with optimal
      defaults.
    </li>
    <li>Zotero: for storing & annotating research documents.</li>
    <li>Neovim: build your own custom text editor.</li>
    <li>
      Zed: a Mac-first hardware accelerated code editor with excellent defaults.
    </li>
  </ul>
  And Obsidian (not FOSS).

  <h3>Great browser extensions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      uBlock Origin: the
      <img src="../gifs/goat.gif" height="20px" alt="goat" />
    </li>
    <li>DeArrow: remove clickbait from YouTube</li>
    <li>
      Google Scholar PDF Reader: the best PDF reader (but I store and annotate
      in Zotero).
    </li>
    <li>Quick Tab Switch: like alt+tab for Chrome tabs.</li>
    <li>Remove YouTube Shorts: DWISOTT</li>
    <li>
      Unhook: minimalise the YouTube UI (disable recommended videos, comments)
    </li>
    <li>
        SponsorBlock: skip in-video YouTube ads.
    </li>
    <li>Zotero Connector: save papers</li>
  </ul>
